A hybrid farming simulation and tower defense game that combines peaceful agricultural management with intense tactical combat in a unique day/night cycle.

## 📖 About

Seeds of Success was a game development prototype that blended two distinct gaming experiences into one cohesive gameplay loop. Players took on the role of a survivor rebuilding their community after an apocalyptic event, managing their farm during the day while defending it against demonic invasions at night.

### Core Concept

- **Day Phase (12 minutes)**: Focus on farming, crafting, exploration, and community building
- **Night Phase (8 minutes)**: Defend your farm against waves of enemies in tactical tower defense combat
- **Interconnected Systems**: Crops grown during the day fuel combat abilities at night, while combat victories unlock new agricultural opportunities

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌱 Agriculture System
- **12 crop varieties** with different growth cycles and strategic uses
- **Animal husbandry**: Chickens, cows, sheep, pigs, fish, and ducks with unique productions
- **Quality system**: Normal, Rare, Epic, and Legendary crop qualities
- **Advanced irrigation**: Manual watering to automated sprinkler systems

### ⚔️ Combat System
- **5-wave enemy attacks** each night with increasing difficulty
- **Multiple enemy types**: Goblins, skeletons, orcs, slimes, and boss encounters
- **Tactical formations**: Protection, and charge formations with specialized villagers
- **Tower defense mechanics**: Build defenses, place traps, and fight alongside your units
- **Boss battles**: Multi-phase demon boss with evolving combat patterns

### 🏘️ Village Management
- **Community building**: Recruit up to 20 specialized villagers
- **NPC roles**: Farmers, blacksmiths, guards, scouts, healers, and engineers
- **Relationship system**: Build trust and unlock personal quests
- **Infrastructure expansion**: Construct workshops, defenses, and production facilities

### 🛠️ Crafting & Progression
- **Dual progression systems**: Separate farm and combat advancement
- **Extensive crafting**: Weapons, armor, tools, potions, and traps
- **Resource transformation**: Convert agricultural surplus into combat equipment
- **Equipment upgrades**: Enhance items from level 1 to 5

## 🎮 Technical Details

- **Language**: GDScript
- **Platform**: PC (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Art Style**: 2D Pixel Art
- **Target Performance**: 60 FPS minimum
